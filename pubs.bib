  abstract = {Background: Economic and supply chain shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to substantial increases in the numbers of individuals experiencing food-related hardship in the US, with programs aimed at addressing food insecurity like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and food pantries seeing significant upticks in utilization. While these programs have improved food access overall, the extent to which diet quality changed, and whether they helped mitigate diet quality disruptions, is not well understood. Objective: To evaluate food insecurity, food pantry and/or SNAP participation associations with diet during the COVID-19 pandemic among Massachusetts adults with lower incomes. Methods: We analyzed data from 1,256 individuals with complete data. Current dietary intake was assessed via food frequency questionnaire. Using Bayesian regression models, we examined associations between pandemic food insecurity, perceived disruption in diet, diet quality, and intakes of individual foods among those who completed a survey in 2020. We assessed interactions by pantry and SNAP participation to determine whether participation moderated these relationships. Results: Individuals experiencing food insecurity reported greater disruption in diet during the pandemic and reduced consumption of healthy/unhealthy foods. Pantry participation attenuated associations between food insecurity and lower consumption of unhealthy (from b = -1.13 [95\%CI -1.97;0.31] to -0.70 [-2.24;0.84]) and healthy foods (-1.07 [-1.82;0.34] to 0.30 [-1.17;1.74]), whereas SNAP attenuated associations for healthy foods alone (-1.07 [-1.82;0.34] to -0.75 [-1.83;0.32]). Results were robust to choice of prior as well as to alternative modeling specifications. Conclusions: Among adults with lower incomes, those experiencing food insecurity consumed less food, regardless of healthfulness, compared to individuals not experiencing food insecurity. Participation in safety-net programs, including SNAP and pantry participation, buffered this phenomenon. Continued support of SNAP and the food bank network and a focus on access to affordable healthy foods may simultaneously alleviate hunger while improving nutrition security.},

  abstract = {In the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), families may temporarily lose benefits for which they are still eligible because of administrative issues. This lapse in benefits, referred to as churning, increases the risk of food insecurity for families, which is linked with poorer health.To examine the rate of churning among SNAP participants with young children and evaluate the association of administrative policy changes with churning risk.A cross-sectional study of recertifications among 9735 SNAP-participating households with at least 1 child younger than 6 years from May to November 2019 tested whether there were sociodemographic differences in churning risk. An interrupted time series analysis of recertifications among 70\,799 households from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019, tested whether state-level administrative policy changes were associated with churning risk. Data were analyzed between February and November 2021.Three Massachusetts SNAP administrative policy changes.Churn episodes, defined as losing SNAP benefits after a deadline for eligibility recertification followed by receiving benefits again within 30 days, measured using state SNAP administrative data.In 2019, a total of 9752 recertification events occurred among 9735 households (3841 [39.4\%] Hispanic, 2138 [21.9\%] non-Hispanic Black, and 3533 [36.2\%] White) with at least 1 child younger than 6 years participating in SNAP. Of these households, 3984 (40.9\%) experienced SNAP churning for a period of 1 to 30 days because of missed recertification forms in any given month. Churning was more common among Hispanic households (by 3.9 percentage points; 95\% CI, 1.2-6.6 percentage points) than non-Hispanic White households and more common among households with more than 1 child younger than 6 years (by 5.6 percentage points; 95\% CI, 3.0-8.1 percentage points) compared with smaller households. Among households that churned, non-Hispanic White households lost a mean of \$10.51 (95\% CI, \$10.16-\$10.86) in benefits per household member, and non-Hispanic Black households lost an additional \$1.10 (95\% CI, \$0.47-\$1.74) per household member. On implementation of a task-based, first-available-caseworker model, mean churn episode length was significantly shorter immediately on introduction of the model (-0.30 days per each month after the policy change; 95\% CI, -0.52 to -0.07 days) and over time (-0.23 days per each month after the policy change; 95\% CI, -0.26 to -0.20 days). At the addition of a second policy change to expand participants' access to simplified reporting requirements, a decrease was seen in the trend in the probability of a churn episode by -0.74 percentage points per month (95\% CI, -0.87 to -0.62 percentage points). A third policy to expand online services for submitting recertification paperwork was not associated with a change in churn risk over time.Churning in SNAP is common among households with young children and is disproportionately experienced by Black and Hispanic households and lower-income households. Administrative changes to simplify caseworkers' workloads and streamline eligibility reporting for participants may reduce churn.},

The objective of this study was to examine socioeco­ nomic and racial and ethnic disparities in outdoor branded advertising for products harmful to health in San Francisco and Oakland, CA. We collected cross-sectional data on outdoor advertising from 372 blocks with ≥ 1 residential or mixed-residential parcel in SF and Oakland in 2018–2019. Blocks were randomly sampled by city, land use, majority vs. non-majority Black and/or Hispanic composition, and upper and lower tertiles of household income. Advertisements were coded by product, healthfulness, and branding. Exposure variables were neighborhood household median income and percent of residents who were Hispanic of any race, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White. The primary outcome variable was block-level dichotomous presence of any unhealthy branded advertisement for food, beverage, alcohol, or tobacco. Analyses were un­ adjusted and adjusted for land use and number of total advertisements on each block. Each additional \$10,000 in neighborhood household median income was associated with an 11\% lower adjusted odds of having any un­ healthy branded advertisements on the block (95\%CI: 0.80–0.99; P = 0.03). There were no significant associ­ ations between neighborhood racial and ethnic composition and presence of unhealthy branded advertisements, but with each 10\% higher neighborhood composition of Hispanic residents, there was a borderline significant higher presence of unhealthy branded advertisements (OR = 1.23; 95\%CI: 1.00–1.51; P = 0.05). Results indicate that low-income neighborhoods were disproportionately exposed to outdoor branded advertisements for un­ healthy products.},

  abstract = {Introduction The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; Free/Reduced Priced Lunch Program; and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children reduce food insecurity for millions of Americans with lower incomes. However, critics have questioned whether they increase obesity. This study examined whether program participation was associated with BMI z-score from kindergarten to fifth grade. Methods Data from 4,457 primary-grade students whose household incomes were equal to or below 200\% of the federal poverty level from kindergarten to fifth grade as part of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010‒2011 were analyzed. Marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment/censoring weights were used to estimate associations between Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program/Free and Reduced Priced Lunch participation over time and fifth-grade BMI z-score, accounting for lost-to-follow-up and time-varying confounders. Weighted generalized estimating equations were used to examine associations between Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children participation and BMI z-score trends. All analyses incorporated sampling weights. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010‒2011 data were collected from 2010-2016; analyses were conducted in 2021 and 2022. Results At baseline, 2,419 (54.3\%) respondents participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, 3,993 (89.6\%) participated in Free/Reduced Priced Lunch, and 3,755 (84.2\%) reported past participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. No associations were found between any program and fifth-grade BMI z-score or between Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children participation and BMI z-score trend. Conclusions Previous findings of relationships between program participation and BMI may have been because of weaker study designs and uncontrolled confounding. Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; Free/Reduced Priced Lunch; and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children was not associated with increased risk of childhood obesity in this recently conducted longitudinal study.},

  abstract = {Weight stigma is a pressing issue that affects individuals across the weight distribution. The role of social media in both alleviating and exacerbating weight bias has received growing attention. On one hand, biased algorithms on social media platforms may filter out posts from individuals in stigmatized groups and concentrate exposure to content that perpetuates problematic norms about weight. Individuals may also be more likely to engage in attacks due to increased anonymity and lack of substantive consequences online. The critical influence of social media in shaping beliefs may also lead to the internalization of weight stigma. However, social media could also be used as a positive agent of change. Movements such as Body Positivity, the Fatosphere, and Health at Every Size have helped counter negative stereotypes and provide more inclusive spaces. To support these efforts, governments should continue to explore legislative solutions to enact anti-weight discrimination policies, and platforms should invest in diverse content moderation teams with dedicated weight bias training while interrogating bias in existing algorithms. Public health practitioners and clinicians should leverage social media as a tool in weight management interventions and increase awareness of stigmatizing online content among their patients. Finally, researchers must explore how experiences of stigma differ across in-person and virtual settings and critically evaluate existing research methodologies and terminology. Addressing weight stigma on social media will take a concerted effort across an expansive set of stakeholders, but the benefits to population health are consequential and well-worth our collective attention.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Most previous studies on food insecurity and cardiovascular disease risk factors are cross-sectional. Without longitudinal data, it is unclear whether food insecurity precedes poor health and how exposure timing impacts these relationships. METHODS: Data from 2000 to 2001, 2005 to 2006, and 2010 to 2011 of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study were used. Food insufficiency-a screener measure related to food insecurity-was assessed in 2000-2001 and 2005-2006 using a single item. Cardiovascular disease risk factors were objectively assessed in 2010-2011. Impacts of food insufficiency patterns (food sufficient, food insufficient in 2000-2001 only, food insufficient in 2005-2006 only, food insufficient in both 2000-2001 and 2005-2006) on cardiovascular disease risk factors were estimated using inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models. Covariates that change over time were adjusted for using stabilized weights; baseline covariates were adjusted for in the marginal structural models. Analyses were conducted in 2020-2021. RESULTS: The baseline sample included 2,596 participants (56\% women, 47\% White). In unadjusted analyses, all food insufficiency patterns were associated with higher BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure than food sufficiency. After accounting for covariates, estimates were attenuated but still consistent with adverse effects of food insufficiency, particularly among women. CONCLUSIONS: After covariate adjustment, food insufficiency was associated with several cardiovascular disease risk factors. Findings from this study should be replicated in other settings and populations. If verified, this evidence could provide justification for intervening in food insecurity to reduce future cardiovascular disease risk.},

We collected pretax (April-May 2017) and posttax (April-May 2018) retail prices of SSBs and non-SSBs from 155 stores in Oakland, San Francisco, and comparison cities. We analyzed data using difference-in-differences high-dimensional fixed-effects regressions, weighted by regional beverage sales.Results. Across all beverage sizes, the weighted average price of SSBs increased by 0.92 cents per ounce (95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,0.28, 1.56) in Oakland and 1.00 cents per ounce (95\% CI\,=\,0.35, 1.65) in San Francisco, compared with prices in untaxed cities. The tax did not significantly alter prices of water, 100\% juice, or milk of any size examined. Diet soda only, among non-SSBs, exhibited a higher price increase for some sizes in taxed cities.Conclusions. Within 4 to 10 months of implementation, Oakland's and San Francisco's SSB excise taxes significantly increased SSB retail prices by approximately the amount of the taxes, a key mechanism for reducing consumption.

Pretax consumption (2014) was compared with a weighted average of 3 years of posttax consumption.Results. At baseline, SSBs were consumed 1.25 times per day (95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,1.00, 1.50) in Berkeley and 1.27 times per day (95\% CI\,=\,1.13, 1.42) in comparison city neighborhoods. When we adjusted for covariates, consumption in Berkeley declined by 0.55 times per day (95\% CI\,=\,−0.75, −0.35) for SSBs and increased by 1.02 times per day (95\% CI\,=\,0.54, 1.50) for water.

One major barrier to producing empirical evidence to establish this link is that there is little consensus on how to measure gentrification. To address this barrier, we compared three gentrification classification methodologies in relation to their ability to identify neighborhood gentrification in nine San Francisco Bay Area counties: the Freeman method, the Landis method, and the Urban Displacement Project (UDP) Regional Early Warning System. In the 1580 census tracts, 43\% of the population had a bachelor’s degree or higher. The average median household income was \$79,671 in 2013. A comparison of gentrification methodologies revealed that the Landis and Freeman methodologies characterized the vast majority of census tracts as stable, and only 5.2\% and 6.1\% of tracts as gentrifying. UDP characterized 46.7\% of tracts at risk, undergoing, or experiencing advanced stages of gentrification and displacement. There was substantial variation in the geographic location of tracts identified as gentrifying across methods. Given the variation in characterizations of gentrification across measures, studies evaluating associations between gentrification and health should consider using multiple measures of gentrification to examine the robustness of the study findings across measures.},

In 2018 and 2019, we formally evaluated retailers’ perceptions of SSB taxes using semi-structured interviews (including open- and closed-ended questions) with 103 randomly selected retailers (50 corner and liquor stores; 28 chain convenience, drug, and mass-merchandise stores; 18 chain supermarkets and discount supermarkets; and 7 independent supermarkets) across 3 cities with SSB taxes (Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco); interviews occurred in 2018 and 2019 (approximately 3 years, 1 year and 6 months post tax-implementation, respectively). A majority of both small and large retailers reported the tax had only a minimal effect on their business (70\%). About half of retailers believed that other cities should adopt SSB taxes (53\%), and were supportive of a statewide SSB tax (53\%), noting it would level the playing field and better support health in their communities. Retailers’ responses did not differ based on neighborhood income, and only 2 responses differed significantly between large and small retailers. Only 2 of 103 retailers reported raising the price of a non-beverage product in response to the tax, specifically raising the price of snack foods of low nutritional quality and alcoholic beverages. A majority of retailers in 3 California cities with SSB taxes have no concerns regarding the tax, endorse the health goals of SSB taxes and support statewide expansion of SSB tax policies.},
