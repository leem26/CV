%% SUMMARY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{adjustwidth}{0.7cm}{0.7cm} \parskip 8pt \begin{small} \textbf{Summary:} I am a PhD candidate in Population Health Sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the Department of Nutrition. My professional interests are focused on policies and interventions related to food systems and the environment that improve cardiometabolic outcomes, as well as the application of novel causal inference and simulation-based methods to advance population health and health equity research.
